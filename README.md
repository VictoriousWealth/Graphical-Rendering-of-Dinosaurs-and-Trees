Designed and implemented a Java-based graphical application to visualize pixelated dinosaurs and trees using EasyGraphics and EasyReader libraries. Key features include:
Graphics Rendering:
Rendered detailed pixel-based representations of dinosaurs and trees on a dynamic background.
Incorporated features like inverted orientations and randomized tree placements for visual diversity.
Data Processing:
Parsed data from an external file to populate multi-dimensional arrays for rendering.
Utilized modular functions to manage graphical elements and streamline rendering processes.
Customizable Visuals:
Created interactive graphics with elements such as:
Sky and grass backgrounds using layered rectangles.
Trees with trunks and leaves in randomized locations.
Dinosaurs of varying sizes and orientations.
Technical Stack:
Leveraged EasyGraphics for graphical plotting and EasyReader for efficient file input.
Employed color-coding logic for distinguishing components like dinosaurs, leaves, and trunks.
This project demonstrates creativity and proficiency in graphical programming, array manipulation, and structured design.
